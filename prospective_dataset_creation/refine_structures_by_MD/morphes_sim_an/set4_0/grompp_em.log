WARNING 1 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp, line 77]:
  You are using soft-core interactions while the Van der Waals interactions
  are not decoupled (note that the sc-coul option is only active when using
  lambda states). Although this will not lead to errors, you will need much
  more sampling than without soft-core interactions. Consider using
  sc-alpha=0.


NOTE 1 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp]:
  Replacing vdwtype=Switch by the equivalent combination of vdwtype=Cut-off
  and vdw_modifier=Potential-switch


NOTE 2 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp]:
  With PME there is a minor soft core effect present at the cut-off,
  proportional to (LJsigma/rcoulomb)^6. This could have a minor effect on
  energy conservation, but usually other effects dominate. With a common
  sigma value of 0.34 nm the fraction of the particle-particle potential at
  the cut-off at lambda=0.5 is around 2.2e-05, while ewald-rtol is 1.0e-05.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

WARNING 2 [file MOL_posre.itp, line 3]:
  Some parameters for bonded interaction involving perturbed atoms are
  specified explicitly in state A, but not B - copying A to B


NOTE 4 [file topol.top, line 66]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -2.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  



WARNING 3 [file topol.top, line 66]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

NOTE 5 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.


NOTE 6 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.



NOTE 7 [file /home/ykhalak/Projects/ML_dG/pde2_dG/generators/structures/set_4/morphing_annealing_4d09//data/mdp/em_for_sim_an.mdp]:
  For free energy simulations, the optimal load limit increases from 0.5 to
  0.667
